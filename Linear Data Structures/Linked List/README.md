Linked List
A linked list is a data structure that is used to store data.It has following properties : 
1. Successive elements are connected by pointers
2. The last element points to NULL
3. Can grow or shrink in size during execution of a program
4. Can be made just as long as required (until systems memory exhausts)
5. Does not waste memory space (but takes some extra memory for pointers). It 
allocates memory as list grows.

The following are the operations performed in a Linked List : 
1. Insert     - Insert an element(node) into the list
2. Delete     - Removing an element(node) from the list
3. Find       - Finding an element(node) from the list
4. Traversing - Traversing each element(node) in the list

Inserting a new node - We can insert a new node to a list at the beginning or at the end or at any random location in the Linked List
Deleting a node - We can delete any node whether it is first node , last node or any intermediate node.
Traversing the list - In Linked List Traversal we follow the Pointer and display the content of node as they are traversed and then we stop when pointer points to NULL.
